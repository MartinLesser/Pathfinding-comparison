# README #

This project implements the pathfinding algorithms dijkstra, A* and D* Lite and compares their performances. The comparison is done by generating random labyrinths of any size and lets an agent find a path through it. While traversing the labyrinth the shortest path will be blocked at random. This enables the D* Lite algorithm to shine, because it is a dynamic algorithm, which recalculates a new path without discarding the previous path calculation.

### What is this repository for? ###

* code of practice project for college (Fachhochschule Erfurt)
* implementing different pathfinding algorithms
* comparison of the performances
